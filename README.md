Simulated file system using trees and recursion in Java

## 🗂️ Overview
This project simulates a file system as a directory tree, where each node represents either a file or a folder. Using a tree structure, the program can compute folder sizes, build paths between nodes, and perform operations like copy-paste or cut-paste using recursion.

## 📌 Features
- Differentiates between files and folders using inheritance
- Calculates total folder size recursively
- Finds the lowest common ancestor of two file system objects
- Builds path strings between any two nodes (like `../folderA/file.txt`)
- Simulates real-world file management logic

## 🧠 Key Skills
- Tree traversal and manipulation
- Recursive algorithms
- Inheritance and abstraction in Java
- Algorithm design and debugging
- File system simulation concepts
